# PROJECT: julia-the-bot 👸🏽

*Do you find yourself feeling bored? If so, you need not worry anymore! Our digital companion, Julia, is here to chat with you. You can ask her anything, share details about yourself, and she will engage in conversation with you at all times.*

## 💠 PYTHON Libraries used:

⭐ **urllib.request**

The urllib.request module defines functions and classes which help in opening URLs (mostly HTTP) in a complex world— basic and digest authentication, redirections, cookies and more.

⭐ **bs4 (Beautiful Soup)**

Beautiful Soup is a library that makes it easy to scrape information from web pages. It sits atop an HTML or XML parser, providing Pythonic idioms for iterating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.

⭐ **csv (Comma Separated Values)**

The csv module implements classes to read and write tabular data in CSV format. It allows programmers to say, “write this data in the format preferred by Excel,” or “read data from this file which was generated by Excel,” without knowing the precise details of the CSV format used by Excel.

⭐ **nltk (Natural Language Toolkit)** 

NLTK has a module, nltk.chat, which simplifies building these talk bots by providing a generic framework.
